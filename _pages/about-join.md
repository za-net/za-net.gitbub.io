## Build Your Own

If you prefer a hands-on approach, you can build your own repeater or micro node. With the right hardware and guidance, constructing your own equipment can be a rewarding experience and offers flexibility in customization.

To build your own, checkout the links under the About > Guides and HowTo's section.
