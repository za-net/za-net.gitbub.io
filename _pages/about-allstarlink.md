AllStarLink is an open-source project that utilizes Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology to create a network linking amateur radio systems together over the internet. It allows radio users to communicate with each other through repeaters, remote bases, and simplex nodes, regardless of their physical location. AllStarLink provides a platform for building and operating Amateur Radio linking systems, enabling amateur radio enthusiasts to extend the reach and capabilities of their radio communications.

At its core, AllStarLink works by converting analog audio signals from radios into digital data packets, which are then transmitted over the internet to other connected nodes. This digital transmission allows for clear, reliable communication over long distances without the need for traditional radio frequency (RF) propagation. AllStarLink supports a variety of hardware configurations, including dedicated computers, Raspberry Pi devices, and specialized interface boards, making it accessible to a wide range of users with varying technical expertise.

One of the key features of AllStarLink is its flexibility and scalability. Users can easily customize and expand their linking systems to meet their specific needs, whether they are setting up a simple point-to-point link between two repeaters or creating a complex network of interconnected nodes covering multiple regions. AllStarLink also offers a range of advanced features and functionality, such as voice conferencing, remote base operation, telemetry reporting, and more, allowing users to explore new capabilities and enhance their radio communication experience.

AllStarLink is supported by a dedicated community of amateur radio enthusiasts who contribute to its development, maintenance, and support. As an open-source project, AllStarLink encourages collaboration and innovation, with users sharing knowledge, resources, and expertise to improve the platform for everyone. Whether you're a seasoned amateur radio operator or just starting out, AllStarLink provides a welcoming environment where you can learn, connect, and participate in the exciting world of amateur radio linking.
